Summary of the DriverPass Project
DriverPass wanted a system to help people prepare for their driving tests. They needed a way for customers to book lessons, take practice tests, and track their progress online. The goal was to lower the high failure rate for driving tests by offering better tools and resources.

What I Did Well
I think I did a solid job outlining the technical and functional requirements. Everything from role-based access to integrating DMV updates was well thought out. Plus, the design is secure and scalable, which means it can handle growth in the future.

What I’d Improve
If I could go back, I’d focus more on making the system scalable from the start. Adding features or handling a ton of new users could be tricky with the current setup. Also, I’d include more ways to get user feedback, like surveys or a suggestion box, to keep improving the system.

Meeting User Needs
To meet user needs, I focused on making the system easy to use and mobile-friendly. I also made sure everyone—from customers to employees—had tools that fit their role. For example, customers can book lessons online, while admins can view reports and manage accounts. Considering user needs is huge because if the system isn’t easy or useful, no one’s going to stick around.

My Approach to Design
I broke the project into smaller steps, like gathering requirements, creating diagrams, and building out features. Next time, I’d use techniques like user personas and spend more time testing the design with real users. I’d also use agile methods to get feedback as I go, so the system keeps getting better during development.
